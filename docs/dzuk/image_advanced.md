# Slightly more advanced image output method

## Parameters (`-p`)

```
-p whoopdedoo.orx
```

This is the only thing you'll use for image input flags in this advanced method.

Parameters is a file where you insert various bits that you would do in the simpler method, but you can basically just pack more varied things into orxporter this way.

Parameters is an [orx file](orx.md), like the Manifest file, but it's a lot simpler.
